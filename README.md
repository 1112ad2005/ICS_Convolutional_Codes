# ICS_Convolutional_Codes
Myself Ayush Dhamecha. Here, i have attached all the work that has been done by group of 10 students at Dhirubhai Ambani University, Gandhinagar. I have served as a group leader of this project under guidance of the course instructor Prof. Yash Vasavada.


Here is the all informaiton related to the project.

-- Delieverable:
  Convolutional encoder for the rates and constraint lengths for the following rates and
   constraint lengths [r,Kc]:
   ▷ {r =1/2,Kc = 3} 
   ▷ {r =1/3,Kc = 4} 
   ▷ {r =1/3,Kc = 6} 
  Pass the output of the encoder to a BPSK modulator, and the transmitted BPSK sym
  bols to an AWGN channel which introduces a per-symbol SNR of ES/N0. See Ap
  pendix A.
  Perform soft decision and hard decision Viterbi decoding and demonstrate the perfor
  mance by varying the SNR Eb/N0 ∈ {0,10} in steps of 0.5 dB. Produce the curves
  showing the probability of errors  and Bit error rates as a function of Eb/N0 for 
  each value of r.

-- Analysis:
 Study and explain the derivations of the performance of the soft decision decoder of
 convolution code.
 Study and explain the derivations of the performance of the hard decision decoder of
 convolution code.
 Compare the simulation results of SDD and HDD with their respective analysis results
 for all the three convolution codes mentioned above.

-- Simulation result:
